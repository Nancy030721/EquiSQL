plan for Nov 11th
1.add real as data type (DONE)
2.allow more than one table (DONE)
3.implement inner join (explicit & implicit) (DONE)
4.support arithematic operations like +, -, * (ODNE)

currently, table aliasing is not allowed, and I'm forcing people to type in 'table.column' rather than 'column' itself.

so next steps:
1.enable table aliasing 
2.implement select * 




commands to test:
1.
python main.py test/create-table.sql test/query1.sql test/query2.sql
expected: counterexample
2.
python main.py test/create-table2.sql test/query3.sql test/query4.sql 
expected: EQUIVALENT
