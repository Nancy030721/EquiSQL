Tests without join:
1.apply distinct on primary key -- no difference 
python main.py test/distinct/create-table.sql test/distinct/simple/distinct1.sql test/distinct/simple/distinct2.sql 
expected: EQUIVALENT

2.apply distinct on some non-unique attribute(s) 
python main.py test/distinct/create-table.sql test/distinct/simple/distinct3.sql test/distinct/simple/distinct4.sql 
expected: counterexample

3.apply distinct on a combo of primary key and other attribute 
python main.py test/distinct/create-table.sql test/distinct/simple/distinct5.sql test/distinct/simple/distinct6.sql 
expected: EQUIVALENT


Tests with join:
1.Distinct on left table's primary key after inner join -- some key value can only be found in left but not right 
python main.py test/distinct/create-table.sql test/distinct/plus_join/distinct_join1.sql test/distinct/simpel/distinct2.sql 
expected: counterexample
 
2.Distinct on left table's primary key after left join / full join 
python main.py test/distinct/create-table.sql test/distinct/plus_join/distinct_join2.sql test/distinct/simpel/distinct2.sql 
expected: EQUIVALENT

3.Distinct on right table's primary key after left join 
python main.py test/distinct/create-table.sql test/distinct/plus_join/distinct_join3.sql test/distinct/simpel/distinct2.sql 
expected: counterexample

4.Distinct on (left.key, right.key) after full join
python main.py test/distinct/create-table.sql test/distinct/plus_join/distinct_join4.sql test/distinct/plus_join/distinct_join5.sql
expected: counterexample


the key insight is that we need to check:

1.If there is join?
Yes --> 2.Will that affect the UNIQUENESS of key?
        No --> add constraint  
               (if T is on 
                    1) either side of inner join, or
                    2) left side of left join 
                    3) right side of right join)
        Yes --> don't add constraint
                (anything else )
No --> add constraint that the primary key is distinct and not null


also other things to keep in mind, like how to generate encoding for distinct on more than one attribute
